## Terraform_Monitoring
In this project, I used Terraform to automate the provisioning of infrastructure for monitoring. Instead of manually creating servers and configuring tools, Terraform lets me define everything as code. With one command, I spun up an EC2 instance on AWS, installed Prometheus and Grafana, and exposed dashboards.

The value here is reliability and repeatability. If Moniepoint needs to monitor 10 or 100 services, I can spin up infrastructure consistently and quickly. If a server fails, we can recreate the same environment in minutes with Terraform.

This project shows that I can combine monitoring skills with automation and cloud infrastructure management, which is essential for scaling in a fast-growing company like Moniepoint.
